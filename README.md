## Thoughts on the project
This project was pretty fun. I think the most interesting part about this project was trying to figure out how to optimize it because it calls for quite a few objects. When I originally setup the waypoints, I had way too many. I had to revisit them a few times to figure out how I could reduce the number I had.
